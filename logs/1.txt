/tmp files are cleared on reboot, they could be controlled by /etc/init/mounted-tmp.conf prior to 14.04. The default value of $TMPTIME is 0, which means every file and directory in /tmp gets deleted. $TMPTIME is an environment variable defined in /etc/default/rcS.

For 16.04 , man "tmpfiles.d"
<<
#/etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf

d /tmp 1777 root root 20d
>>

Overlay file systems are heirarchical union of directories with read only permissions for lower level directory, and write permissions for same tier directories.

NVM-e IO are fast, faster than RAMs, thus traditional applications don't work to the full extent of IO speed because write/read is app -> RAM -> HDD, but for NVMe(s) they can be used as ephemeral and persistent storage.

TIL that when random docker images are encountered using something like tini: https://github.com/hexops/dockerfile#use-tini-as-your-entrypoint helps to figure out what is the image about.

So SIGTERM sent by ansible  wasn't being responded to and the child processes still exists. This is a problem with how subprocesses work in Python2, described better in latter blogpost.

On how application/database servers handle connection. Mysql opens threads, postgres opens processes, redis does something like Node, handling one request at a time from an event loop.

GFS has a nice write pattern. To make concurrent writes, it uses snapshot and record. Then merge it with time, eventually reaching a consistent state. Since it's assumed that most of the 
writes are append.

IOPS or input, output per second can be assesed for different parameters namely random reads/writes and sequential read/writes
